Java Interpretation of Gaussian Elimination Algorithm with Partial Pivoting

==================

In order to use, you will be prompted to enter in the matrix

If the matrix has A = 2 4 2     B = -2
                      4 3 6          2
                      2 5 6          8

Then you will enter 3 for Rows, 4 for Columns

And your augmented matrix would be:
 Row 1: 2 4 2 -2
 Row 2: 4 3 6  2
 Row 3: 2 5 6  8

This program will also solve the system, and the solved values
of the system are stored in a one-dimensional matrix called "solution"
